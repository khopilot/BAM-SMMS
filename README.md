- Modern web technologies (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Platform-specific dependencies:
  - **Windows**: Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools
  - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools
  - **Linux**: Various packages (see [Tauri setup docs](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites))

## Quick Start

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enoreyes/starter-app
cd starter-app
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the desktop application:

```bash
npm run tauri:dev
```

This will launch a native desktop window application, not just a browser tab. The first build may take a few minutes as Rust dependencies are compiled.

## Available Commands

- `npm run tauri:dev` - Start the desktop application in development mode
- `npm run tauri:build` - Build the desktop application for production
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Run linting
